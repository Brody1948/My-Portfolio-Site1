        <h2>The Problem
        </h2>
        <p>
          Being passionate and having a desire to enjoy the outdoors through various recreational activities has grown, considerably, in the last 10 years. Accessible information and environmental awareness via social media and the internet has aided
          this interest, substanially.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a vast amount of information right at your fingertips, also comes with unorganized, misleading, insufficient, and inaccurate information. Unfortunately, this is a situation people experience whenever researching national parks, state
          parks, public land, etc. Sifting through all the information is time consuming, frustrating, and sometimes infuriating.
        </p>
        <p>
          Enjoying experiences/services over products are more sought after in age groups 40 and down. While enjoying the outdoors, people would like to experience the local scene near their distination. This can include restuarants, cafés, bakeries,
          breweries, lodging, local events, groceries, nearby gas stations, etc. Currently, people have to spend additional time switching back and forth between various applications to find these options near their destination.
        </p>
        <p>
          What if there was an application that provided users with quick detailed information on all outdoor areas and recreational activities pertaining to them. On top of that, users can easily view local options catered to the proximity of the
          viewed content. Here is where SAUNTER comes in.

                Great job specializing in day hikes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Falls short in providing sufficient amount of details and options for the activities provided.
              </li>
              <li>

            <h4>Hiking Project</h4>

                Good application for just hiking.

              <li>
                Navigational issues/bugs, but nothing serious.
              </li>
              <li>
                Their weakness is also user submitted data and the fact that they solely focus on hiking within this application.

            <h4>Insight</h4>
            <ul>

                No option to find local options near viewed content.

              <li>
                No social aspect within each application, besides the ability to leave a review/comment.
              </li>
              <li>

            <h3>Users</h3>
            <h4>Target Audience</h4>
            <p>
              The apps core demographic is 18-38. These are the most physically active years.
            </p>
            <h4>Interviews</h4>
            <p>
              After reviewing the current competition, I moved into interviews. I focused on individuals who were passionate about outdoor activity, to moderately, and infrequent.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the results from my initial interviews I constructed an affinity map to organize the users behaviors, attitudes, needs & goals, and frustrations.
            </p>
            <h4>Surveys</h4>
            <p>
              To acquire quick information, I found conducting surveys to be the best method.
            </p>
            <h4>Insights</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A strong need for organized information.
              </li>
              <li>
                A need for sufficient information on a variety of outdoor categories.
              </li>
              <li>
                Users found it frustrating that the features they use outdoors were divided amongst different applications.
              </li>
              <li>
                The ability to view local options near viewed content reminded them of their frustration when searching the web for related options.
              </li>
              <li>
                The idea of a social platform within the application sounded appealing. They found it to be relaxing to connect with people on a shared interest, discovering new places to visit.

              In order to further empathize with the user's experience, user journeys were created. This allowed me to step into their shoes during the design process.
            </p>
            <p>
              To assist with understanding how users interact within the app for various objectives and scenarios, I developed user flows to bring to life the target audience.

                At this stage, the process of designing the application had begun.
              </p>
              <p>
                To effectively visualize the information architecture of Saunter, I created a sitemap for the mobile and desktop versions.
                Not only did this help me organize the navigation of this application, but to discover flaws within the functionality.
              </p>
              <p>
                To understand how users perceive and understand information I held card sorting sessions with them. These sessions were monumental in structuring the information architecture effectiveness.
              </p>
              <p>
                To effectively digest the hierarchical results, I inputed the data into a dendrogram diagram and matrix similarity diagram.

              <h2>Wireframes, Usability tests & Iterations</h2>
              <p>
                Since user research truly continues through out the entire design process, constant updates to the overall design was natural and necessary. Progressing from low-fidelity to high-fidelity.
              </p>
              <h4>Usability Feedback</h4>
              <h5>Filter Icon</h5>
              <p>
                Confusion and trouble locating the filter icon.
              </p>
              <h5>Adjustment</h5>
              <p>
                Changed the filter icon to one that is more familiar and made it part of the applications header shown in the entire app.
              </p>
              <h5>Search Bar</h5>
              <p>
                Users did not understand which search bar they were accessing, nor did they like the idea of having one search bar for all sections.
              </p>
              <h5>Adjustment</h5>
              <p>
                Placed labels within the search bar of each sections. Added a drop-down search bar filter for the desktop version. This allowed users to change the search bar from Social to Outdoor, instead of accessing the Outdoor section to begin
                a
                search.
              </p>
              <h5>Ask an Expert - Mobile</h5>
              <p>
                Users stuggled locating the 'ask an expert' feature during their usability tests. I attemped changing the icon 3 times, but they were still unsure what it entailed.
              </p>
              <h5>Adjustment</h5>
              <p>
                Took the feature off the main toolbar. The feature is not frequently accessed, nor does the toolbar provide enough realestate. I moved the feature to the main menu. Here the user will find the icon labeled as 'Ask an Expert',
                instead of
                'Expert' as it was shown on the toolbar.
              </p>
              <h5>Main Menu - Mobile</h5>
              <p>
                When first designing, I planned to have it slide in from the side and push the content to the right. Users did not respond well to this addition. They found it to be confusing, nor visually appealing.
              </p>
              <h5>Adjustment</h5>
              <p>
                I removed the sliding feature and replaced the menu to a full page that covered the screen. Users responded well to this update during the usability tests.
